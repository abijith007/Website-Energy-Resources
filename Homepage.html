<b>Man is surrounded by an ocean of energy but he has been able to tap only a fraction of it. The most colossal dynamo of all 
energy is the sun, an unimaginable vast powerhouse which affects everything on earth.<br><br>

But then, why do we hear about energy crisis? We know that energy can be converted from one form to another and that energy 
can neither be created nor be destroyed. But in all processes whether it is a physical process or a chemical one we observe 
that the energy in the usable form is dissipated to the surroundings in less usable forms. Hence, any source of energy we use, 
to do work, is consumed and cannot be used again.<br><br>

The term 'energy' used here has thus a slightly different meaning. The term 'energy' actually means 'the useful energy' or 
'the energy that we can use'; for cooking, operating machines, to run vehicles and so on. And we get this useful energy only 
from specific sources, which we call 'sources of energy
