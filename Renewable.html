Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale 
such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four 
distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services.

<br><br>
<div style="width:60%; float:left">
Hydel energy is produced by utilizing the kinetic energy of flowing water. Huge dams are built over a source of water. Water 
is collected behind the dam and released. When the water falls on the turbine; the turbine moves; because of kinetic energy of 
water. Thus, electricity is generated by the turbine. Electricity; thus generated is called hydel energy or hydroelectricity. 
Water in the reservoir is replenished with rainwater and so availability of water is not a problem for hydroelectricity.

<br><br>
<div style="width:60%; float:left">
The plants and animals constitute the biomass. Firewood from plants is used as kitchen fuel. If large number of trees can 
be planted, then a continuous supply of firewood can be ensured. Farm waste; such as stalks of harvested plants and dung of 
cattle; can be used to generate methane. The decomposition of biomass produces methane; which can be channelized for useful 
purposes.<br>
<u><i><mark>Bio-gas Plant:</mark></u></i> Bio-gas plant can be very useful in solving the energy need of rural areas. A bio-gas plant is 
a dome-like structure which is usually built from bricks and concrete. In the mixing tank; the slurry is made from cow-dung 
and water. The slurry then goes to the digester; which is a closed chamber. Since oxygen is absent in the digester, the 
anaerobes carry on their work of decomposition. The process of decomposition produces biogas. Biogas has about 70% of methane 
and the rest is composed of other gases. The biogas is channelized through a pipe and can be utilized as kitchen fuel and also 
as fuel for getting light. The slurry; left behind; is removed. It is used as manure, once it dries.<br><br><br><br><br>

<font color=Orange size=6><u>Wind Energy</u></font>
<br><br>
Wind energy has been in use since ages. The sail boats of the pre-industrialization era used to run on wind power. Windmills 
have been in use; especially in Holland; since the medieval period. Now-a-days, windmills are being used to generate 
electricity. The kinetic energy of wind is utilize to run the turbines; which generate electricity.
<br><br>
At present, Germany is the leading country in terms of wind energy production and India comes at number five. In India, Tamil 
Nadu is the largest wind energy producing state. The largest wind farm in India is near Kanyakumari; in Tamil Nadu; which 
generates 380 MW of electricity.

<font color=gold size=6><u>Solar Energy</u></font>
<br><br>
The sun is the main source of energy for all living beings on this earth. Even the energy in the fossil fuels has come from 
the sun. The sun has an endless reservoir of energy which would be available as long as the solar system is in existence. 
Technologies for harnessing the solar energy have been developed in recent times.
<br><Br>
<mark>Solar Cells:</mark> Solar cells are made from silicon. The solar panel converts solar energy into electrical energy which is stored in 
a battery; for later use.

<font color=blue size=6><u>Tidal Energy</u></font>
<br><Br>
Due to the gravitational pull of the moon, tides happen near seashores. Water rushes up near the seashore during a high tide 
and goes down during a low tide. Dams are built near seashores to collect the water which comes during a high tide. When the 
water runs back to the ocean, the flow of water can be utilized to generate electricity.

<a name="ote">
<font color=green size=6.<u>Ocean Thermal Energy</u></font>
<br><br>
The water at sea surface is hot during daytime, while the water at lower level is cold. The temperature differential in water 
levels can be utilized to generate energy. If the temperature differential is more than 20Â°C, then ocean thermal energy can be 
utilized from that place. For this, a volatile liquid; like ammonia; is boiled using the heat from the hot water at the surface. 
The steam of the volatile liquid is utilized to run the turbine to generate electricity. Colder water from the surface below is 
utilized to condense ammonia vapour which is then channelized to the surface to repeat the cycle.
<br><br>
Various methods of harnessing energy from the sea are still at experimental stages.

<br><br>
The molten rocks from the inside of the earth are pushed in certain regions of the earth. Such regions are called the hot spots 
of the earth. When groundwater comes in contact with such hot spots, lot of steam is generated. This steam can be harnessed to 
produce energy. Many power plants in New Zealand and USA operate on geothermal energy.

<font color=red size=6><u>Nuclear Energy</u></font>
Nuclear fission is the process during which two nuclei fuse to form one nucleus. The process generates a huge amount of energy. 
This phenomenon is utilized in nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safest for the environment but the risk of damage due to 
accidental leaks of radiation is pretty high. Further, storage of nuclear waste is a big problem because of potential risk of 
radiation involved. Nonetheless, many countries are using nuclear power in a big way. India too has built many nuclear power 
plants. Recent accidents in the nuclear power plants in Chernobyl and Japan have forced the policymakers to rethink about the 
nuclear power.
