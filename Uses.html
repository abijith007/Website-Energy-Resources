Mankind has grown from his stone age  life style to the current modern day's safe and secured life style by harnessing the 
forces of nature to his advantage through transformation of energy from one form to another.
By nature, all living things need bioenergetics and food energy to keep them strong and continue with their activities.  All 
living things take energy from external sources.  Plants take their energy from sunlight and animals takes chemical energy from 
other living things including plants.
<br><br>
In the context of chemistry, a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of the substances either 
through heat or light. We used these laws of chemical transformation to our advantage and harnessed it to our needs. Energy 
can be transformed and during the transformation, mankind can derive its needs from them.  Items that transforms are called 
transducers. Examples of transducers include battery through which the chemical energy to electrical energy, a dam through 
which gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy, a turbine through which the kinetic energy to electrical energy, etc.
In nature too, energy transforms from one another like continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc and also 
through meteorological phenomena like wind, rain, storms, etc.<br><br>
<font color=red><u>Benefits of Energy:</u></font><br>
Mankind has harnessed the energy by understanding its transformation principles and its laws and has made his life more 
comfortable and safe against nature.  
Following are the major utilization of energy by mankind. <br>

<ol>

<li> Transformed potential energy in water by building reservoirs and releasing its kinetic energy through gravity and 
converting the same into electrical energy through turbines.  Electricity changed the life of mankind and it's a great 
discovery and its utilized practically in every walks of life.</li>

<li> Transformed electricity into mechanical energy and created moving machines to travel by road, air and water.  He 
transformed the heat energy stored in fossil fuels into mechanical and electrical energy and moved wheels and lifted heavier 
objects like aeroplanes.</li>

<li> Utilized the energy in nano quantities and converted into lasers to repair and heal wounds in living bodies.</li>

<li> Transformed electrical energy into sound waves and electromagnetic energy and created a ring of waves around the space to 
communicate, transfer data and perform instructions remotely thereby activating or performing mechanical actions on wireless 
remote machines and objects.  Eg. Sending and commanding space objects like satellites.</li>

<li> Transformed nuclear energy into electrical energy and utilized electricity for all kinds of imaginable actions and  
needs.</li>

<li> Man has started exploring the options of utilizing pollution free energy like wind, solar and  ocean waves to generate 
electricity.  Though its in the preliminary stage of utilization, in future these pollution free energy will become the most 
sought after energy to produce electricity and heat.</li>
